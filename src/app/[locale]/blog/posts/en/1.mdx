## Overview

University of the Punjab, Lahore – Pakistan was established in 1882. The Department of Physics had a rich history where many renowned physicists, such as Professor Arthur Holly Compton (Physics Nobel Laureate, 1927) and Professor Abdus Salam (Physics Nobel Laureate, 1979), remained associated. An International Conference on 3D Printed and Energy Conversion Materials was held on January 25-26, 2024, at the Department of Physics, University of the Punjab, Lahore – Pakistan. This conference provided young researchers, students, and faculty members a platform to interact and share their research findings. Researchers from Pakistan and abroad participated to share their ideas and recent advances in 3D printing and photocatalysis.

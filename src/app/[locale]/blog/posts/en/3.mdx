## Overview

The Annual International Conference on Advances in Materials Science (AIMS) was a prestigious event initiated by the Department of Physics, Division of Science and Technology, University of Education, Lahore. AIMS was conceived as a platform for young researchers to engage with and learn from the experiences of leading scientists from around the world in various facets of materials science.

AIMS served as an interdisciplinary forum where researchers and faculty members working in both basic and applied materials research exchanged ideas, discussed the latest breakthroughs, and explored future directions in the field. The conference attracted eminent scientists from across the globe, who shared their cutting-edge research findings and insights into the evolving landscape of materials science and technology.

AIMS-2023, the 4th Annual International Conference, was held on November 29-30, 2023. The event saw participation from over 13 countries and included more than 170 talks delivered both physically and online, continuing the tradition of fostering global collaboration in materials science.

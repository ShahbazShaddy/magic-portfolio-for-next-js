## Overview
The First International Conference on Advances in Functional Materials (ICAFM-2023) was held in the Department of Physics, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan, on February 20-22, 2023. Functional materials were recognized as an integral part of almost all devices. To meet the future technological needs, novel functional materials with suitable combinations of chemical and physical properties were required to increase the overall performance and efficiency of devices. Designing high-performance functional materials was considered important to meet the requirements of future needs.

ICAFM-2023 covered thematic research areas of advanced materials, highlighting ongoing cutting-edge research and addressing the challenges faced by researchers and engineers in designing materials and integrating these materials into devices.

This event provided a platform for researchers from academia and R&D institutions to interact and share their ideas to address future trends in light of recent advances in functional materials research.

ICAFM-2023 was an international meeting that provided a platform for national and international participants to discuss and share their ideas and recent advances in functional materials. Graduate students and researchers (both from academia and industry) working on advanced functional materials participated in ICAFM-2023.
